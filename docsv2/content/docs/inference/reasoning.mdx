## What is reasoning?

Reasoning mode is a capability available in certain AI models that allows them to engage in explicit step-by-step reasoning before providing their final answer. When reasoning mode is enabled, the model generates internal "thoughts" that show its reasoning process, problem-solving steps, and decision-making logic.

Reasoning mode can unlock better inference capabilities in complex use cases; however, it can add extra cost and latency, since the **reasoning content** is generated prior to the response and count towards the used tokens. It is important to consider the trade-off when enabling reasoning mode.

## Configuration

All providers have a different way of configuring reasoning mode or returning the reasoning content:
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning) and [xAI](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/reasoning) expose a **reasoning effort** parameter (`low`, `medium`, `high`).
- [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) and [Google](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking) allow providing a thinking budget, limiting the number of tokens used for thinking.
- Fireworks does not support configuring reasoning mode

To reconcile differences between providers, WorkflowAI converts back and forth between a reasoning effort and a reasoning budget (also called thinking budget).

Each reasoning effort level corresponds to a reasoning budget that allocates a specific percentage of the model's maximum output tokens.

| Reasoning Effort | Maximum Token Budget |
|------------------|---------------------|
| `disabled` | Disables reasoning when possible |
| `low` | **20%** of maximum output tokens |
| `medium` | **50%** of maximum output tokens |
| `high` | **80%** of maximum output tokens |

In the inverse, the reasoning budget is converted to a reasoning effort:

| Token Budget Range | Converted to Effort |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `0`% | `disabled` (disables reasoning when possible) |
| Up to **20%** of max tokens | `low` |
| **20%** - **50%** of max tokens | `medium` |
| Above **50%** of max tokens | `high` |

Reasoning can be configured via the `reasoning` request parameter which is an object with the following fields:
- `budget`: integer, the reasoning budget in tokens
- `effort`: string, the reasoning effort, one of `disabled`, `low`, `medium`, `high`

<Tabs items={["Budget", "Effort"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```json
  {
    "reasoning": {
      "budget": 10000
    }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```json
  {
    "reasoning": {
      "effort": "medium"
    }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Either `budget` or `effort` can be provided, but not both.

<Callout type="error">
TODO: add table about reasoning effort and budget for each provider by calling the /v1/models endpoint
</Callout>


<Callout type="info">
As explained above, the way providers allow configuring reasoning is different. The same value can be sent differently to each provider. For example, given a reasoning budget of `50k tokens`, WorkflowAI will send:
- a reasoning effort of `medium` if using o3, since o3 has max output tokens of 100k
- a thinking budget of `50k` if using claude 4 sonnet
- nothing if using deepseek r1, since fireworks does not support configuring reasoning
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
OpenAI completion API exposes a `reasoning_effort` (`low`, `medium`, `high`) parameter. It is also supported by WorkflowAI but does not allow configuring a granular thinking budget or disabling reasoning.
</Callout>

## Usage

### Completion API

As explained above, the reasoning effort can be passed as a parameter to the completion API. Thoughts can then be retrieved from the choice object via a WorkflowAI specific field `reasoning_content`.

<Callout type="warning">
As the `reasoning_content` field is not part of the OpenAI API response, it will likely throw a typing issue when accessed.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
For now, since WorkflowAI relies on the OpenAI completion API which does not return the reasoning content, the reasoning content will not be available on OpenAI models.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={["Python", "TypeScript", "JSON"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```python
  res = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-4-sonnet",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?"}],
    extra_body={
      "reasoning": {
        "budget": 10000,
        # or "effort": "low",
      }
    }
  )
  # Access the reasoning content
  print(res.choices[0].message.reasoning_content) # type: ignore
  # Access the reasoning tokens
  print(res.usage.completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens)
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```typescript
  const res = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "claude-4-sonnet",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is the meaning of life?" }],
    extra_body: {
      reasoning: {
        budget: 10000,
        // or "effort": "low",
      }
    }
  });
  // Access the reasoning content
  // @ts-expect-error - reasoning_content is not part of the OpenAI API
  console.log(res.choices[0].message.reasoning_content); 
  // Access the reasoning tokens usage
  console.log(res.usage.completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens);
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```json
  {
    "model": "claude-4-sonnet",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
      }
    ],
    "reasoning": {
      "budget": 10000,
      // or "effort": "low",
    }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


When streaming, the reasoning content deltas are also returned at the same level as the content field.

<Tabs items={["Python", "TypeScript"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```python
  print(res.choices[0].delta.reasoning_content)
  print(res.choices[0].delta.content)
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```typescript
  console.log(res.choices[0].delta.reasoning_content); 
  console.log(res.choices[0].delta.content); 
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Viewing reasoning models

The [WorkflowAI models endpoint](https://run.workflowai.com/v1/models) exposes the parameter `supports.reasoning`.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "claude-4-sonnet",
      ...,
      "supports": {
        "reasoning": true
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

It is also possible to filter for reasoning models via the `reasoning` query parameter.

<Tabs items={["Python", "Curl"]}>
<Tab>
```python
models = openai.models.list(extra_query={"reasoning": True})
# The supports field is ignored by the OpenAI SDK so it is not accessible
print(models.data)
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```sh 
curl https://run.workflowai.com/v1/models?reasoning=true
```
</Tab>

title: Sharing Playgrounds

## Easily share specific playground states with team members 

The playground generates unique URLs for each state, making collaboration effortless. Every time you run a prompt, adjust parameters, or switch models, a new shareable URL is created that captures that exact configuration. This means you can easily share specific runs and version combinations with your team members, allowing them to see exactly what you tested and reproduce your results instantly.

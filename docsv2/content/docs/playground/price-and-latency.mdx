title: Price and Latency
---

## See the price and latency for each model you try

For each output, WorkflowAI also displays:
- 💰 Cost: The total price in USD for generating this output
- ⚡ Latency: How long it took to get a response from the model, in seconds
- 📊 Context window usage: How much of the model's maximum token limit was used, shown as a percentage

> WorkflowAI Cloud offers a price-match guarantee, meaning that you're not charged more than the price per token of the model you're using. Learn more about the price-match guarantee [here](https://workflowai.com/pricing).

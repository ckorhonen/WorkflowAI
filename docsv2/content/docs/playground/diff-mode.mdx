### Unlock easy output comparison with diff mode

Compare LLM outputs side-by-side with visual highlighting to easily spot differences between models and prompt variations.
You can enable diff mode to highlight the differences between LLM outputs, making it easy to spot differences in how models handle your task. Diff mode can be especially helpful for text-heavy outputs, like texts summarizations or composition.

## Overview

The search functionality allows you to find and filter runs, conversations, and insights across your observability data. Use powerful query capabilities to identify patterns, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance trends.

- **Run Search**: Find specific runs by model, cost, duration, status, and metadata
- **Conversation Search**: Filter multi-turn conversations by length, participants, and outcomes  
- **Insight Search**: Query runs by specific insight values and combinations
- **Advanced Filters**: Date ranges, text search, and complex boolean queries
- **Export Capabilities**: Download search results for further analysis
- **Saved Searches**: Create and reuse common search patterns

## Current Capabilities

For now, you can search for runs using the API endpoints documented in:
- [Runs documentation](/docs/observability/runs)
- [Insights search examples](/docs/observability/insights#searching-for-specific-insight-values)

Stay tuned for expanded search capabilities and a dedicated search interface.

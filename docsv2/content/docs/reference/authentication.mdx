WorkflowAI uses API keys for authentication. You can create and manage your API keys in your [organization settings](https://workflowai.com/keys).

Keep your API key secure—never share it or expose it in client-side code (such as browsers or apps). API keys should always be loaded securely from an environment variable or a key management service on your server.

To authenticate, provide your API key using HTTP Bearer authentication.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer WORKFLOWAI_API_KEY
```

## The chat completion object

Represents a chat completion response returned by model, based on the provided input.

### Response Fields

#### `choices` 
**Type:** `array`

A list of chat completion choices. Can be more than one if `n` is greater than 1.

<details>
<summary>Show properties</summary>

- `index` (integer): The index of this choice in the list
- `message` (object): The chat message generated by the model
  - `role` (string): The role of the message author (e.g., "assistant")
  - `content` (string): The content of the message
  - `refusal` (string or null): The refusal message if the model refuses to answer
  - `annotations` (array): Additional annotations on the message
- `logprobs` (object or null): Log probability information
- `finish_reason` (string): The reason the model stopped generating (e.g., "stop", "length", "content_filter")

</details>

#### `created` 
**Type:** `integer`

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the chat completion was created.

#### `id` 
**Type:** `string`

A unique identifier for the chat completion.

#### `model` 
**Type:** `string`

The model used for the chat completion.

#### `object` 
**Type:** `string`

The object type, which is always `chat.completion`.

#### `service_tier` 
**Type:** `string or null`

Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

- If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
- If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarantee.
- If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarantee.
- If set to 'flex', the request will be processed with the Flex Processing service tier. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex).
- When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier` utilized.

#### `system_fingerprint` 
**Type:** `string`

This fingerprint represents the backend configuration that the model runs with.

Can be used in conjunction with the `seed` request parameter to understand when backend changes have been made that might impact determinism.

#### `usage` 
**Type:** `object`

Usage statistics for the completion request.

- `prompt_tokens` (integer): Number of tokens in the prompt
- `completion_tokens` (integer): Number of tokens in the generated completion
- `total_tokens` (integer): Total number of tokens used in the request (prompt + completion)
- `prompt_tokens_details` (object): Detailed breakdown of prompt tokens
  - `cached_tokens` (integer): Number of tokens that were cached
  - `audio_tokens` (integer): Number of audio tokens in the prompt
- `completion_tokens_details` (object): Detailed breakdown of completion tokens
  - `reasoning_tokens` (integer): Number of tokens used for reasoning
  - `audio_tokens` (integer): Number of audio tokens in the completion

  - `rejected_prediction_tokens` (integer): Number of rejected prediction tokens

## Extra fields in completion response

In the completion response, the choice object includes the following fields that are not defined in the OpenAI API:
- **feedback_token**: the feedback token for the completion, as described in the [User Feedback](/docs/guides/user-feedback.md) documentation.
- **duration_seconds**: the duration of the completion in seconds
- **cost_usd**: the cost of the generation in USD for that specific choice

## Streaming Responses

When `stream: true` is set, the response will be sent as data-only server-sent events. See the [Streaming guide](../guides/streaming.md) for more details on handling streaming responses.

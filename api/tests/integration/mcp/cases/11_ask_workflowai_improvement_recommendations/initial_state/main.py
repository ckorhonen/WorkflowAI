Analyze emails and assign priority levels based on:
- URGENCY: Time-sensitive matters, deadlines, meetings
- IMPORTANCE: Impact on work, relationships, or goals
- SENDER: VIP contacts, colleagues, customers vs spam/marketing
- CONTENT: Action items, requests, information sharing
- CONTEXT: Keywords like "urgent", "asap", "deadline", "meeting"

Priority Guidelines:
- HIGH: Urgent + Important (CEO emails, client issues, deadlines today)
- MEDIUM: Important but not urgent, or urgent but less important
  * Meeting notes, summaries, and follow-ups from colleagues
  * Work-related information sharing that may contain decisions or action items
  * Updates from team members about project progress or outcomes
- LOW: FYI emails, newsletters, marketing, non-urgent personal updates

Output ONLY the priority level (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) no other text.""",
